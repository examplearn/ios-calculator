## What you will build

You will build a clone of the basic iOS Calculator in this project. The application will look exactly like the basic iOS Calculator, and functions properly. However, different from the iOS Calculator, this application won't turn into a scentific calculator when the landscape view is used.

By building this project, you will learn how to use CSS to style a relatively complex mobile application, as well as deal with the logic of a calculator in a systematic approach.
